# **Custom Magento Reports with Google Chart API**

Easily create reports with custom MYSQL queries and display them using the Magento Admin Grid or using [Google Charts API][1].

### **Features**
- Report result table
 -  Ability to define column configuration or allow auto configuration.
- The following Google Charts are currently supported, please see the examples:
 - [Pie Chart][2]
 - [Bar Chart][3]
 - [Column Chart][4]
 - [Calendar Chart][5]
     - When querying for the date, you must query the date using [UNIX_TIMESTAMP()][6] like the following:
         - `UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date([[date field]]))`
- Control access to viewing, editing, and creation of reports in Magento ACL list.
- Cache results in dynamically created tables for performance and historical reasons.
- Select separate database connection to run queries against

#### **Future Things**
- Fix the calendar chart to support more than 1 year.
